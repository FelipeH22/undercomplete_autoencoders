# undercomplete_autoencoders
Implementation of an undercomplete autoencoder using convolutional neural networks (CNN) for the MNIST handwritten digit dataset. The main objective is to compare the results between training the neural network with the binary cross-entropy loss function and training it with the mean squared error loss function.
